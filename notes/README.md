# Daily Notes Format

## Commitments vs. Inputs

Daily notes use a two-tier system for organizing content:

- **Checkboxes (`- [ ]`)** are used for actionable commitments that you intend to complete or roll over
- **Bullets (`-`)** are used for review sections, link dumps, reading/reference lists, and general notes

## Reserved Link-Dump Headers

The following headers (case-insensitive) are reserved and should remain as bullets, not checkboxes:
- `review`
- `links`
- `reading`
- `reference`
- `watch`
- `listen`

Additionally, any bullet where all immediate children are URLs is treated as a link dump header and remains a bullet.

## Rollover Mechanism

Unchecked checkbox tasks (`- [ ]`) serve as the basis for rolling over commitments to future days. Only actionable commitments that haven't been completed should remain as unchecked checkboxes.
