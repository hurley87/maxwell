## Reference
- Email replies: I sign off with "Thanks," (not "Best regards,").
- Ryan Cairns is my brother-in-law, friend, and accountant. He sometimes sends automated emails; often I need to reply, but sometimes it's just a task to complete (no reply needed).
- BillHurley78 (william.hurleyrmc@gmail.com) is my dad.
- Email style: avoid starting a sentence with "Curious:"; use "In your example,".
- Context engineering: this is what I do in software engineering — I write specs; LLMs write code.

Dad is writing a chapter on "Using Agentic LLMs to Solve Defence Analytics Problems."
